We've all experienced moments where the right song at the right time has the power to heal wounds, spark joy, or offer solace. Yet, the vast musical landscape often conceals the treasures of good music, making it a challenge to discover the perfect tune that resonates with our hearts.\n","\n","Recognizing the profound impact that music has on our lives, I embark on a journey to create an enchanting project. This project is dedicated to the art of music recommendation, but with a twist that sets it apart from the ordinary. Rather than solely relying on genre, tempo, or artist, our project takes a more lyrical approach. We aim to delve into the very essence of songs, exploring their rich tapestries of words and sentiments.\n","\n","I aim to assist in discovering the perfect musical companion for any moment by recommending songs based on the topics and themes found in their lyrics. The lyrics of a song are the poetic expressions of the artist's heart and mind, and within them, we often find reflections of our own experiences, emotions, and desires. This project seeks to connect music lovers with songs that speak to the unique stories of their lives, songs that provide solace in difficult times and amplify your joy during moments of celebration.\n","\n","With the charm of song lyrics as my guide, I aspire to create a recommendation system that doesn't just understand musical preferences but also comprehends the lyrical narratives that resonate with the soul. Through this innovative approach, I aim to assist you in finding the perfect soundtrack to your life's unfolding story.\n","\n","Join me on this captivating journey as I explore the enchanting world of song lyrics to recommend music that not only suits your tastes but also speaks to your heart. Together, we will uncover the hidden gems that complement the various chapters of your life and add an extra layer of magic to your musical experience."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7FwJYmkGJMO6"},"source":["## **OBJECTIVE**\n","\n","To develop a music recommendation system that intimately connects listeners with songs through the power of lyrics."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NCHUxNyEM4Wy"},"source":["## **INSTALL DEPENDENCIES**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20,"status":"ok","timestamp":1698613478723,"user":{"displayName":"Ugwu Chukwuemeka","userId":"16925398294240703700"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"flFOe9uVv1xp","outputId":"70427ac9-af1d-46be-88b0-767c693fea95"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sun Oct 29 21:04:37 2023       \n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 525.105.17   Driver Version: 525.105.17   CUDA Version: 12.0     |\n","|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

It's a way to automatically discover abstract topics from a large dataset of text, enabling researchers and analysts to understand the main ideas or subjects discussed in the documents without having to read through them individually.\n","\n","Below is how topic modeling works in a nutshell:\n","\n","- Document Collection: Start with a large collection of text documents, such as articles, research papers, or social media posts.\n","\n","- Vectorization: Convert the text into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings. This step transforms words into numerical vectors that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.\n","\n","- Algorithm Application: Apply a topic modeling algorithm, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to the numerical representations of the documents. These algorithms analyze patterns in word co-occurrence to identify topics. I used NMF in my solution.\n","\n","- Topic Identification: The algorithm identifies groups of words that frequently occur together in the documents. Each group of words represents a topic. Importantly, the algorithm does this without any prior knowledge of the topics or the documents.\n","\n","- Interpretation: After the algorithm has identified topics, analysts interpret these topics based on the words that are most strongly associated with each topic. They can then label the topics based on these interpretations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6383,"status":"ok","timestamp":1697214544159,"user":{"displayName":"Ugwu

The input text can be a song lyric or topics. The text undergoes preprocessing, which typically includes tokenization and cleaning to prepare the text for analysis.The preprocessed text is transformed using a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer. TF-IDF quantifies the importance of words in the text relative to a corpus of documents. It assigns numerical values to words based on their frequency in the text and inverse frequency across a collection of texts.\n","\n","The TF-IDF transformed text is further processed using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a technique used for topic modeling. NMF decomposes the text into topics, represented as distributions of words. In this context, it helps identify the underlying thematic structure within the lyrics.\n","\n","The code then determines the dominant topic in the text by finding the index with the highest value in the NMF-transformed features. This index corresponds to the specific topic number, indicating the main theme of the input text.\n","\n","To provide insights into the dominant topic, the code extracts and presents the top 20 words associated with this topic. These words are determined based on the coefficients stored in the components_df_ DataFrame, revealing the key thematic elements identified by the model.\n","\n","Following this, the code counts the number of words in the input text that match the top words associated with the dominant topic. This word matching process helps gauge the thematic relevance of the input lyrics to the identified topic.\n","\n","Lastly, the code applies a threshold to filter songs from the final_df DataFrame. Songs are selected where the count of topic-related words exceeds the specified threshold. This filtered list represents song recommendations based on thematic similarity to the provided lyrics, allowing users to explore songs that share similar thematic elements and emotions."],"metadata":{"id":"r4MzX8tjM8WU"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":380},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16643,"status":"ok","timestamp":1698613745140,"user":{"displayName":"Ugwu Chukwuemeka","userId":"16925398294240703700"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"PgBiCRjQLph0","outputId":"c8c373b1-24c6-4817-f471-51bcb070b53b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         artist                                                seq  \\\n","0  Elijah Blake  No, no\\r\\nI ain't ever trapped out the bando\\r...   \n","1  Elijah Blake  The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel m...   \n","2  Elijah Blake  She don't live on planet Earth no more\\r\\nShe ...   \n","3  Elijah Blake  Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low\\...   \n","4  Elijah Blake  I see a midnight panther, so gallant and so br...   \n","\n","                                       seq_cleaned_1  \\\n","0  no no i ain t ever trapped out the bando but o...   \n","1  the drinks go down and smoke goes up i feel my...   \n","2  she don t live on planet earth no more she fou...   \n","3  trippin off that grigio mobbin lights low trip...   \n","4  i see a midnight panther so gallant and so bra...   \n","\n","                                       seq_cleaned_2  \\\n","0  ever trapped bando oh lord get wrong know coup...   \n","1  drinks go smoke goes feel got let go cares get...   \n","2  live planet earth found love venus word said n...   \n","3  trippin grigio mobbin lights low trippin grigi...   \n","4  see midnight panther gallant brave found found...   \n","\n","                                       seq_cleaned_3  \\\n","0  bando oh lord couple place everybody name atti...   \n","1  drinks smoke cares crowd lights eyes live till...   \n","2  planet earth venus word space time movin fault...   \n","3  trippin grigio lights trippin grigio lights tr...   \n","4  midnight panther gallant brave answers thunder...   \n","\n","                                              topics                song  \n","0  money pay dollar cash pocket car paper clothes...
